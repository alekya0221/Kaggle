    "## 1. Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The insurance domain is characterized by complex policy documents that contain critical information such as benefits, exclusions, premium details, and terms. For both customers and agents, quickly finding accurate answers from these documents is challenging. Our project addresses this problem by developing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that leverages advanced language models to retrieve, re-rank, and generate answers from insurance policy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose frameworks like **LangChain** and **LlamaIndex** as they provide modular, extensible components for:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Document Ingestion:**  \n",
    "  Our code uses `pdfplumber` to load and process PDFs, which mirrors the document loaders and data connectors found in LangChain and LlamaIndex.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Embedding and Retrieval:**  \n",
    "  We generate embeddings using OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` and store them in ChromaDB, reflecting the vector representation and semantic search capabilities provided by both frameworks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LLM Integration:**  \n",
    "  The integration with GPT-3.5-turbo for generating natural language responses is a key aspect of our pipeline, similar to how LangChain and LlamaIndex interface with large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Re-ranking:**  \n",
    "  We use a cross encoder (`cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) to re-rank the initial semantic search results, which is a feature supported by both frameworks to improve result relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This clear mapping of components shows why LangChain or LlamaIndex would be ideal choices for building a robust end-to-end RAG system like ours.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These frameworks are ideal for our problem because they support end-to-end pipelines that combine retrieval (from large document corpora) with generation, resulting in more accurate and verifiable answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Overall System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Architecture and Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Ingestion and Preprocessing:**\n",
    "   - **PDF Extraction:** We use `pdfplumber` to extract text and tables from insurance policy PDFs.\n",
    "   - **Text Segmentation:** The extracted content is processed to separate regular text from tabular data using bounding box checks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Preparation and Indexing:**\n",
    "   - **Data Structuring:** Extracted text and metadata (e.g., policy name and page number) are stored in a DataFrame.\n",
    "   - **Embedding Generation:** We generate embeddings for each page using OpenAI's `text-embedding-ada-002` model.\n",
    "   - **Vector Storage:** The embeddings are stored in a persistent ChromaDB collection, enabling fast semantic search.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Retrieval and Re-ranking:**\n",
    "   - **Semantic Search:** We perform initial retrieval on the stored embeddings to get the top responses.\n",
    "   - **Cache Mechanism:** A separate cache collection stores previous query results to optimize performance.\n",
    "   - **Cross Encoder Re-ranking:** We re-rank the retrieved responses using the `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` model from Sentence Transformers to ensure higher relevance.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Generation:**\n",
    "   - **Prompt Construction:** A detailed prompt is built with the user query and top search results.\n",
    "   - **LLM Response:** GPT-3.5-turbo is used to generate a final answer that includes citations from the source documents.\n",
    "   \n",
    "5. **Output Delivery:**\n",
    "   - The final response is displayed to the user, including relevant citations (policy name and page numbers) to verify the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Innovation and Use of Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Design:** Our implementation combines custom code with components inspired by LangChain and LlamaIndex, such as document loaders, embedding functions, vector stores, and re-ranking models.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Approach:** We integrate semantic search with a caching mechanism and cross encoder re-ranking to achieve a robust, efficient, and accurate retrieval pipeline.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** The system can be extended to include additional document types, more sophisticated indexing, and improved query handling as needed.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case study, we successfully developed a robust Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system tailored for the insurance domain. Our system effectively extracts information from complex insurance policy documents and utilizes state-of-the-art language models for semantic search, re-ranking, and natural language response generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the project, we:\n",
    "- Built a comprehensive pipeline incorporating document ingestion, text and table extraction, data preprocessing, and embedding generation.\n",
    "- Leveraged ChromaDB for efficient vector storage and retrieval, combined with a cross encoder to refine our search results.\n",
    "- Integrated GPT-3.5-turbo to generate detailed, verifiable responses with appropriate citations from the policy documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The responses generated for various user queries were accurate, informative, and well-formatted, demonstrating the system’s ability to serve as an effective generative search assistant in the insurance space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this case study highlights the practical benefits of combining modern NLP techniques with a modular framework (inspired by LangChain and LlamaIndex) to solve real-world problems. The success of our system suggests promising potential for further enhancements, such as integrating additional data sources or expanding the scope of queries.\n"
